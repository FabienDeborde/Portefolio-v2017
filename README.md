# Personal Portefolio

Finally took the time to redesign my own portefolio website!

For this project I used (as usual) ***Jade*** (now Pug), ***SASS*** and ***JavaScript*** (with ***jQuery***).<br>
I also tried different libraries (you can find them in *src/assets/js/vendor*), but in the end I just used a custom ***smoothscrolling script***, ***gumshoe*** to link the scrolling to the navigation menu, and ***masonry*** with ***imagesLoaded*** for the *Work* section.

The most difficult part here was to get a nice experience on every devices, and I had a hard time getting masonry to do what I wanted.

*The page rely heavily on JavaScript, but is still somewhat usable without (you won't see the parallax effect and the pretty stuff but the page is scrollable and the form is working).*

I hope you enjoy the design, and if you have any comments, you can send me a message on Twitter [@fabiendeborde](https://twitter.com/fabiendeborde)
